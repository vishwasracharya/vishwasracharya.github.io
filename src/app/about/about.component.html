            <p>
                Greetings. With regard to my academic background, I have attained a ðŸŽ“ Bachelor's degree in Information Technology Engineering from Sardar Patel College of Engineering, located near Vallabh Vidhyanagar, my current place of residence. I relocated to this city during the 10th grade, prior to which I resided in Khambhat. Currently, I am employed as a Software Engineer at <a class="text-decoration-none" target="_blank" href="https://volansys.com/">@Volansys.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                In the past, I was a rather introverted individual. However, to overcome my reticence and as a supplementary occupation, I produced <a class="text-decoration-none" href="https://youtube.com/c/VishwasAcharya">Youtube</a> videos, created <a class="text-decoration-none" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7DQt4atsshjsEG0Am49lHr?si=ii3DcV4JQT2CxOJWWidZKg&utm_source=copy-link">Podcasts</a>, and pursued my passion for photography, which I showcased on my <a class="text-decoration-none" href="https://instagram.com/vishwasracharya">Instagram</a> profile.
            </p>
            <p>
                During times of personal lowðŸ¥±, or when I am feeling unproductive, I engage in listening to music ðŸŽ¶ and dancing to it as a means of rejuvenation and reestablishing my focus.
